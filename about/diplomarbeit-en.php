<h3><strong>General Introduction</strong></h3>
<p>Migratory
	birds have to cross or circumvent two vast areas, the Sahara Desert and the Mediterreanean
	Sea, during their migratory journey between their breeding areas in Europe and
	their wintering areas in Africa. A lot of day migrants such as raptors, herons
	and storks avoid crossing the Mediterranean Sea and concentrate at the Straits
	of Gibraltar and Bosporus. But most birds migrate by night and until recently
	relatively little was known about how and to what extent these night migrants
	cross the Mediterranean Sea and the Sahara.
</p>
<p>It was supposed that they fly on a more or less broad front across the Mediterranean
	and the Sahara during night and day (Moreau 1972, Curry-Lindahl 1981). Early radar
	and visual observations gave no evidence for concentrations along the shortest
	routes, such as Gibraltar, Sicily or Malta (Casement 1966) and many surveillance
	radar studies suggested no deviations in tracks when birds flew across coastlines
	(Eastwood 1967). In recent years however, field observations have shown that mountain
	ridges can lead to local concentrations of the migratory stream (Bruderer 1996)
	and that coasts can influence the flight behaviour of migrants (Alerstam, 1977).
	It was argued that at least some of the birds maintained their temporal pattern
	of flying by night and resting during the day even over a large ecological barrier
	such as the Sahara (Biebach et al. 1986, Bairlein 1988). </p>
<p>Therefore, the <a href="https://www.vogelwarte.ch" target="_blank">Swiss Ornithological
		Institute</a> carried out a study supported by the <a href="https://www.snf.ch/" target="_blank">Swiss
		National Science Foundation</a>, where bird migration across the western Mediterranean
	was investigated in autumn 1996 and spring 1997. The aim of this study was to
	find out if the the migratory stream occurs over a broad front across the Mediterranean
	Sea and if islands such as the Balearic Islands, in particular the coastlines,
	influence the migratory stream. Two tracking radars were operated, one on the
	southern tip of the island Mallorca, the other near Malaga at the coast on the
	Spanish mainland. Moon and infrared observations along the French and Spanish
	coast provided additional information over a larger scale.</p>
<p> This diploma thesis was part of the project. It focused on the temporal and
	spatial pattern of nocturnal bird migration over Mallorca during the spring season
	as recorded by radar. The thesis was divided into two themes which were analysed
	and discussed in detail: </p>
<p>1) the temporal and seasonal schedule of the migration intensities and<br/>
	2) the direction, speed, and potential recruiting areas of the migrants.</p>
